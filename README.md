# Data-Weight-Arduino-Project

Project description: 
  To visually show the data value, we consider using the scale-like device to compare the 'weight' of items placed on each side.  The 'weight' refers to the weight of their respective data values, rather than the physical weight. We also have developed our own set of data value measurement criteria under which we give our selected items a data value score. Besides, while weighting items in different size, there could be a contrast between the weight of the object itself and its data value. So, the heavier item may have lighter weight in data value dimension. Eventually, we want to raise usersâ€™ awareness of personal data protection in this data weight game.
